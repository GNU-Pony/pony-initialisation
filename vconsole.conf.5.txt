NAME
----
vconsole.conf - configuration file for the virtual console

SYNOPSIS
--------
*/etc/vconsole.conf*

DESCRIPTION
-----------
The /etc/vconsole.conf file configures the virtual console, i.e. keyboard mapping and console font.

The basic file format of the vconsole.conf is a newline-separated list environment-like shell-compatible variable assignments. It is
possible to source the configuration from shell scripts, however, beyond mere variable assignments no shell features are supported,
allowing applications to read the file without implementing a shell compatible execution engine.

In Arch /etc/rc.conf is checked for vconsole configuration as well as described below, however only as fallback.

OPTIONS
-------
The following options are understood:

*KEYMAP=*
//, KEYMAP_TOGGLE=
//The KEYMAP_TOGGLE= can be used to configured a second toggle keymap and is by default unset.
//  KEYMAP= defaults to us if not set.

	Configures the key mapping table of for they keyboard. Overriding KEYMAP from rc.conf.

*FONT=*, *FONT_MAP=*
//, FONT_UNIMAP=
// the unicode font map
//  FONT= defaults to latarcyrheb-sun16.

	Configures the console font and the console map. Overriding respectively CONSOLEFONT and CONSOLEMAP from rc.conf.

EXAMPLE
-------
*Example 1. German keyboard and console*

/etc/vconsole.conf:

	KEYMAP=de-latin1
	FONT=latarcyrheb-sun16
