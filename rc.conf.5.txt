Name
----
rc.conf - Arch Linux main configuration file

Synopsis
--------
*/etc/rc.conf*

Description
-----------
The */etc/rc.conf* file is the system configuration file for Arch-specific
settings. The format is bash. It contains several commonly-edited settings such
as timezone; keymap; kernel modules; daemons to load at start-up; etc. It's
split up in a few sections to categorize configuration settings: localization,
hardware, networking and daemons.

Localization[[L]]
-----------------
*TIMEZONE*::
	Specifies your time zone. Possible time zones are the relative path to a zoneinfo file starting
	from the directory /usr/share/zoneinfo. For example, a German timezone would be Europe/Berlin,
	which refers to the file /usr/share/zoneinfo/Europe/Berlin.
	Note: if unset, the value in /etc/localtime is used unchanged
	Default: "Canada/Pacific"

*HARDWARECLOCK*::
	How to interpret/update the hardware clock. (used by hwclock)
	Options:
	    - empty: fall back to the value in /var/lib/hwclock/adjfile, which defaults to UTC. (recommended)
	    - "UTC": most robust, allows operating systems to abstract local time and ease DST.
	    - "localtime": apply timezone (and DST) in hardwareclock: discouraged.
	      Choose this if you dualboot with an OS which cannot handle UTC BIOS times correctly, like Windows.
	    - any other value will result in the hardware clock being left untouched (useful for virtualization)
	Default: empty

*KEYMAP*::
	Defines the keymap to load with the loadkeys program on bootup.
	Possible keymaps are found in /usr/share/kbd/keymaps. Please note that this
	setting is only valid for your TTYs, not any graphical window managers or X.
	Defalut: empty

*CONSOLEFONT*::
	Defines the console font to load with the setfont program on bootup.
	Possible fonts are found in /usr/share/kbd/consolefonts. (only needed for non-US)
	Default: empty

*CONSOLEMAP*::
	Defines the console map to load with the setfont program on bootup.
	Possible maps are found in /usr/share/kbd/consoletrans.
	Set this to a map suitable for the appropriate locale (8859-1 for Latin1, for example)
	if you're using an UTF-8 locale and use programs that generate 8-bit output.
	If you're using X11 for everyday work, don't bother,
	as it only affects the output of Linux console applications.
	Default: empty

*LOCALE*::
	This sets your system language, which will be used by all i18n-friendly applications and utilities.
	See `locale -a` (or locale.gen) for available options. 	LANG in /etc/locale.conf takes precedence.
	If unset, it falls back to the C locale.
	Default: empty

*DAEMON_LOCALE*::
	If set to 'yes', use $LOCALE as the locale during daemon startup and during the boot process.
	If set to 'no', the C locale is used.
	Default: "no"

*USECOLOR*::
	use ANSI color sequences in startup messages
	Default: "yes"

Hardware[[H]]
-------------

*MODULES*::
	Modules to load at boot-up.  To blacklist modules, see "man modprobe.conf".
	Default: ().

*UDEV_TIMEOUT*::
	Udev settle timeout.
	Default: 30

*USEDMRAID*::
	Scan for FakeRAID (dmraid) Volumes at startup.
	Default: "no"

*USEBTRFS*::
	Scan for BTRFS volumes at startup.
	Default: "no"

*USELVM*::
	Scan for LVM volume groups at startup, required if you use LVM.
	Default: "no"

Networking[[N]]
---------------

*HOSTNAME*::
	Hostname of machine. Should also be put in /etc/hosts.
	Default: "myhost"

The following settings help you setting up a wired network.

*interface*::
	Name of device.
	Default: empty
	Required for manual configuration as well as DHCP.
	Use 'ip addr' or 'ls /sys/class/net/' to see all available interfaces.

*address*::
	IP address.
	Default: empty
	Required for manual configuration, empty for DHCP.

*netmask*::
	Subnet mask.
	Default: empty (which means 255.255.255.0)
	Optional for manual configuration, ignored for DHCP.

*broadcast*::
	Broadcast address.
	Default: empty
	Optional for manual configuration, ignored for DHCP.

*gateway*::
	Default route.
	Default: empty
	Required for manual configuration, ignored for DHCP.

*Static IP example*::
	interface=eth0
	address=192.168.0.2
	netmask=255.255.255.0
	broadcast=192.168.0.255
	gateway=192.168.0.1

*DHCP example*::
	interface=eth0
	address=
	netmask=
	gateway=

The following options might be needed for advanced use-cases.

*NETWORK_PERSIST*::
	Setting this to "yes" will skip network shutdown.
	This is required if your root device is on NFS.
	Default: "no"

*NETWORKS*::
	Enable these netcfg profiles at boot-up. These are useful if you happen to
	need more advanced network features than the simple network service
	supports, such as multiple network configurations (ie, laptop users)
	   - set to 'menu' to present a menu during boot-up (dialog package required)
	   - prefix an entry with a ! to disable it
	Network profiles are found in /etc/network.d
	This requires the netcfg package
	Default: (main), (commented out).

Daemons[[D]]
------------
*DAEMONS*::
	Daemons to start at boot-up (in this order)
	   - prefix a daemon with a ! to disable it
	   - prefix a daemon with a @ to start it up in the background

	If you are sure nothing else touches your hardware clock (such as ntpd or
	a dual-boot), you might want to enable 'hwclock'. Note that this will only
	make a difference if the hwclock program has been calibrated correctly.

	If you use a network filesystem you should enable 'netfs'.

	Default: (syslog-ng network crond)
