NAME
----
rc.conf - Arch Linux main configuration file

SYNOPSIS
--------
/etc/rc.conf

DESCRIPTION
-----------
The /etc/rc.conf file is the system configuration file for Arch-specific
settings. The format is bash. It contains several commonly-edited settings such
as timezone; keymap; kernel modules; daemons to load at start-up; etc. It is
split up in a few sections to categorize configuration settings: localization,
hardware, networking and daemons.

LOCALIZATION[[L]]
-----------------
*TIMEZONE=*

Specifies the timezone. The setting takes effect on boot by ensuring that /etc/localtime is a symlink
to the correct zoneinfo file. Possible timezones are the relative path to a zoneinfo file starting
from the directory /usr/share/zoneinfo. For example, a German timezone would be Europe/Berlin,
which refers to the file /usr/share/zoneinfo/Europe/Berlin.

Note: if empty, /etc/localtime is not changed. This is useful if /etc/localtime is maintained manually
or by a third-party tool; or if there is no reason to change it from what was set during install.

Default: empty

*HARDWARECLOCK=*

How to interpret/update the hardware clock. (used by hwclock)

Options:

	- empty: fall back to the value in /var/lib/hwclock/adjfile, which defaults to UTC. This is recommended
	  as other users of hwclock might change adjfile and hence cause rc.conf and adjfile to be out of sync.
	- "UTC": most robust, allows operating systems to abstract local time and ease DST.
	- "localtime": apply timezone (and DST) in hardwareclock: discouraged.
	  Choose this if you dualboot with an OS which cannot handle UTC BIOS times correctly, like Windows (note
	  that recent Windows'es can use UTC, which is preferable).
	- any other value will result in the hardware clock being left untouched (useful for virtualization)

Default: empty

*KEYMAP=*

Defines the keymap to load with the loadkeys program on boot. Possible keymaps are
found in /usr/share/kbd/keymaps. Please note that this setting is only valid for
your TTYs, not any graphical window managers or X. KEYMAP in /etc/vconsole.conf takes
precedence.

Defalut: empty

*CONSOLEFONT=*

Defines the console font to load with the setfont program on boot.
Possible fonts are found in /usr/share/kbd/consolefonts (only needed for non-US).
FONT in /etc/vconsole.conf takes precedence.

Default: empty

*CONSOLEMAP=*

Defines the console map to load with the setfont program on boot. Possible maps are found in
/usr/share/kbd/consoletrans. Set this to a map suitable for the appropriate locale (8859-1 for Latin1,
for example) if you're using an UTF-8 locale and use programs that generate 8-bit output. If you're
using X11 for everyday work, don't bother, as it only affects the output of Linux console applications.
FONT_MAP in /etc/vconsole.conf takes precedence.

Default: empty

*LOCALE=*

This sets your system language, which will be used by all i18n-friendly applications and utilities.
See `locale -a` (or locale.gen) for available options. LANG in /etc/locale.conf takes precedence.
If unset, it falls back to the C locale.

Default: empty

*DAEMON_LOCALE=*

	- If set to 'yes', use $LOCALE as the locale during daemon startup and during the boot process.
	- If set to 'no', the C locale is used.

Default: "yes"

*USECOLOR=*

Use ANSI color sequences in startup messages

Default: "yes"

HARDWARE[[H]]
-------------
*MODULES=*

Modules to load at boot-up.  To blacklist modules, see "man modprobe.conf".

Default: ().

*UDEV_TIMEOUT=*

Udev settle timeout.

Default: 30

*USEDMRAID=*

Scan for FakeRAID (dmraid) Volumes at startup.

Default: "no"

*USEBTRFS=*

Scan for BTRFS volumes at startup.

Default: "no"

*USELVM=*

Scan for LVM volume groups at startup, required if you use LVM.

Default: "no"

NETWORKING[[N]]
---------------
*HOSTNAME=*

Hostname of machine. Should also be put in /etc/hosts. The contents of
/etc/hostname (if not empty) takes precedence.

Default: "myhost"

The following settings help you setting up a wired network.

*interface=*

Name of device. Use 'ip addr' or 'ls /sys/class/net/' to see all available interfaces.

Default: empty

Required for manual configuration as well as DHCP.

*address=*

IP address.

Default: empty

Required for manual configuration, empty for DHCP.

*netmask=*

Subnet mask.

Default: empty (which means 255.255.255.0)

Optional for manual configuration, ignored for DHCP.

*broadcast=*

Broadcast address.

Default: empty

Optional for manual configuration, ignored for DHCP.

*gateway=*

Default route.

Default: empty

Required for manual configuration, ignored for DHCP.

*Static IP example*

	interface=eth0
	address=192.168.0.2
	netmask=255.255.255.0
	broadcast=192.168.0.255
	gateway=192.168.0.1

*DHCP example*

	interface=eth0
	address=
	netmask=
	gateway=

The following options might be needed for advanced use-cases.

*NETWORK_PERSIST=*

Setting this to "yes" will skip network shutdown. This is required if your root device is on NFS.

Default: "no"

*NETWORKS=*

Enable these netcfg profiles at boot-up. These replace the network
configuration above and are useful if you happen to need more advanced
network features than the simple network service supports,
such as multiple network configurations (ie, laptop users).
	   - set to 'menu' to present a menu during boot-up (dialog package required)
	   - prefix an entry with a ! to disable it

Network profiles are found in /etc/network.d
There is a template file included there that can be used to create
new profiles.  This requires the netcfg package.

DAEMONS[[D]]
------------
*DAEMONS=*

Daemons to start at boot-up (in this order)
	- prefix a daemon with a ! to disable it
	- prefix a daemon with a @ to start it up in the background

If you are sure nothing else touches your hardware clock (such as ntpd or
a dual-boot), you might want to enable 'hwclock'. Note that this will only
make a difference if the hwclock program has been calibrated correctly.

If you use a network filesystem you should enable 'netfs'.

Default: (syslog-ng network crond)
