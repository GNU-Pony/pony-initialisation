NAME
----
arch-daemons - Compatibility layer for rc scripts and rc.conf's DAEMONS array

SYNOPSIS
--------
/usr/lib/systemd/arch-daemons

DESCRIPTION
-----------
arch-daemons is executed by systemd at very early boot. It has two purposes:

 * For every rc script in /etc/rc.d/ a wrapper service file is created which will start and stop
   daemons by calling the corresponding rc script. In case a native systemd service file exists
   with the same name, the legacy one is ignored and the native one is used instead.
 * The DAEMONS array in rc.conf is parsed and every daemon that appears there is enabled at boot.
   Furthermore, the ordering dependencies specified in the DAEMONS array is respected (including
   backgrounding).

Note: this is meant as a compatibility layer only for the purposes of easing users' transition
from initscripts to systemd. You are strongly encouraged to not rely on this, but rather use
native systemd services.
