NAME
----
arch-modules-load - Compatibility layer for rc.conf's MODULES array

SYNOPSIS
--------
/usr/lib/systemd/arch-modules-load

DESCRIPTION
-----------
Parses the MODULES array from rc.conf at early boot and passes on the list of modules to load to
systemd-modules-load.

arch-modules-load is only used by initscripts, and systemd-modules-load is used the same by both
initscripts and systemd.

Note: this is meant as a compatibility layer only for the purposes of easing users' transition from
the old rc.conf syntax to the new systemd syntax. You are strongly encouraged to not rely on this,
but rather use the native modules-load.d configuration format.

SEE ALSO
--------

rc.conf(5), systemd-modules-load(8), modules-load.d(5)
