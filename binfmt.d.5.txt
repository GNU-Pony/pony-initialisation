NAME
----
binfmt.d - Configure additional binary formats at boot

SYNOPSIS
--------
/usr/lib/binfmt.d/*.conf

/etc/binfmt.d/*.conf

/run/binfmt.d/*.conf

DESCRIPTION
-----------
*initscripts* uses files from the above directories to configure additional
binary formats to register during boot in the kernel.

CONFIGURATION FORMAT
--------------------
Each file contains a list of binfmt_misc kernel binary format rules.
Consult *binfmt_misc.txt*[1] for more information on registration of
additional binary formats and how to write rules.

Empty lines and lines beginning with ; and # are ignored. Note that this
means you may not use ; and # as delimiter in binary format rules.

Each configuration file is named in the style of <program>.conf. Files in
/etc/ overwrite files with the same name in /usr/lib/. Files in /run
overwrite files with the same name in /etc/ and /usr/lib/. Packages
should install their configuration files in /usr/lib/, files in /etc/ are
reserved for the local administration, which possibly decides to
overwrite the configurations installed from packages. All files are
sorted by filename in alphabetical order, regardless in which of the
directories they reside, to ensure that a specific configuration file
takes precedence over another file with an alphabetically later name.

EXAMPLE
-------
*Example 1. /etc/binfmt.d/wine.conf example:*
