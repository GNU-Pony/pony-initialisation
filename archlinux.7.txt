NAME
----
archlinux - basic configuration

SYNOPSIS
--------
Overview of the basic configuration of Arch Linux.

DESCRIPTION
-----------
Arch Linux exposes the user to the system without hiding any details. This manpage gives a
brief overview of the configuration files that should be set up on a fresh install.

INITSCRIPTS[[I]]
----------------
The initscripts are configured in rc.conf. Here you configure what daemons to start on boot, what storage
technologies should be enabled and, optionally, a basic network setup.

HOSTNAME[[H]]
-------------
The hostname of the machine should be set in /etc/hostname. Additionally, either /etc/hosts should be
configured accordingly, or nss-myhostname should be used. This is needed so the hostname can always
be resolved to the current machine, which is required by some programs.

LOCALIZATION[[L]]
-----------------
Various locales may be enabled in /etc/locale.gen, and generated by locale-gen. The system-wide locale to be used
can be configured in /etc/locale.conf

VIRTUAL CONSOLE[[V]]
--------------------
The virtual console is configured in /etc/vconsole.conf. It allows you to set a font and a keyboard layout, among
other things. Note that these settings only apply to the console, and not if you use X.

TIME[[T]]
---------
The local timezone is configured by symlinking /etc/localtime to the correct zoneinfo file under
/usr/share/zoneinfo/. E.g.,

    /etc/localtime -> /usr/share/zoneinfo/Europe/Paris

The real-time clock, which keeps track of time when the computer is off, can be configured to either
be in UTC or in localtime in /etc/adjtime. The default is UTC.

FILESYSTEMS[[F]]
----------------
Filesystems are configured in /etc/fstab, and encryption mappings are configured in /etc/crypttab.

INITRAMFS[[R]]
--------------
The initramfs is generated by mkinitcpio, and can be configured in /etc/mkinitcpio.conf.

PACKAGE MANAGER[[P]]
--------------------
The package manager, pacman, is configured in /etc/pacman.conf.

BOOTLOADER[[B]]
---------------
GRUB's configuration is generated from /etc/default/grub by grub-mkconfig. Syslinux is configured in /boot/syslinux/syslinux.conf

MODULES[[M]]
------------
Most modules should be loaded on-demand. Modules to be unconditionally loaded at boot can be specified in /etc/modules-load.d/,
and modules to be blacklisted from auto-loading can be configured in /etc/modprobe.d/.
