Releasing

1) create an anotated tag on the format YYYY.MM.X, where YYYY is the year,
   MM is the month and X is a number starting from 1. E.g.:

	$ git tag -a 2011.04.1

2) create a tarball and push it to gerolde and pkgbuild.com (needs 4.3.2 to be done...(

	$ make release

3) check that the PKGBUILD in git is in sync with the PKGBUILD to be released

4) create package and push to testing:

  4.1) [first time only] set up ssh forwarding so you can connect to gerolde from alderaan

    4.1.1) Add "ForwardAgent=yes" to ~/.ssh/config

    4.1.2) Add your private key to the authentication agent "ssh-add"

  4.2) ssh pkgbuild.com

  4.3) [first time only] check out initscripts from svn

    4.3.1) svn checkout -N svn+ssh://gerolde.archlinux.org/srv/svn-packages

    4.3.2) "cd svn-packages && svn update initscripts"

  4.4) get the latest version of initscripts: "cd svn-packages && svn update"

  4.5) update the version field in the PKGBUILD

  4.6) build the package for both arches: "sudo testing-{i686,x86_64}-build"

  4.7) run checkpkg, namcap, and install test at least one of the two packages

  4.8) commit to svn and move package to your staging folder (which needs to exist on gerolde):
       'testingpkg "commit message"'
